        <h2>Homemade eggnog is the perfect way to ring in the holiday season. 
            This eggnog recipe is rich, creamy, and perfectly festive.</h2>
        
            <p>Eggnog is a thick, creamy, and dairy- and egg-based drink. 
            It's traditionally made in large batches and served at holiday gatherings. 
            It's often spiked with bourbon or rum, but it is also frequently served without alcohol.</p>

        <h2>What does eggnog taste like?</h2>
            <p>
                It's hard to explain the flavor of eggnog to someone who hasn't tasted it, but we'll try: 
                Eggnog is custardy, rich, creamy, and sweet. 
                It tastes a bit like melted ice cream that's been spiced with nutmeg.
